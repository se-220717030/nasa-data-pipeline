# NASA Near-Earth Asteroid Hazard Analysis

## Project Question

**Which asteroid features are linked to a “potentially hazardous” label?**

This project uses NASA's Near Earth Object Web Service (NeoWs) to collect data about near-Earth asteroids, their orbital characteristics, and close approaches. Asteroid, orbit, and close-approach data are connected using the asteroid ID to compare potentially hazardous and non-hazardous asteroids.

The project investigates which orbital and close-approach features are associated with the potentially hazardous label. A simple classifier will be developed in a later stage. Since the hazard label is built from absolute magnitude (H) and minimum orbit intersection distance (MOID), H, MOID, and diameter will not be used as model features. The hazard label is treated as a screening label, not an impact forecast.

## Data Sources

### NASA Near Earth Object Web Service (NeoWs)

The primary data source is NASA's Near Earth Object Web Service (NeoWs), a public REST API that provides JSON data about near-Earth asteroids.

The project uses the following NeoWs endpoints:

- **Browse** — provides the asteroid catalogue.
- **Feed** — provides close-approach data for a specified date range.
- **Lookup** — provides detailed information about an individual asteroid.

Official NASA API documentation:

https://api.nasa.gov/#asteroids-neows

Detailed source and provenance information is available in [`docs/sources.md`](docs/sources.md).

The API requires a NASA API key. The key must be provided through an environment variable and must never be committed to the repository.

### Data Entities

The project organizes the collected data into three entities, plus one table for records that cannot be loaded:

- **`asteroids`** — one row per asteroid.
- **`orbits`** — one row per asteroid orbit.
- **`approaches`** — one row per close-approach event.
- **`quarantine`** — one row per raw record that could not be loaded.

The entity tables are connected using the asteroid identifier.

The initial data collection target is at least 5,000 asteroids and their associated close-approach data.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Git
- A NASA API key from the [NASA API portal](https://api.nasa.gov/) (only for ingestion, not for building the database)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/se-220717030/nasa-data-pipeline.git
cd nasa-data-pipeline
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

### 3. Activate the virtual environment

**Windows:**

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Configure the NASA API key

Create a local `.env` file in the repository root and configure the NASA API key using the environment variable expected by the ingestion script.

Check `.env.example` for the required variable name and format.

Never commit the `.env` file or expose API credentials in the repository.

### 6. Run the ingestion script (M1)

From the repository root, run:

```bash
python src/ingest.py
```

The ingestion script retrieves data from the approved NASA NeoWs endpoints and saves the raw responses in `data/raw/`.

Each run preserves the original responses and uses UTC retrieval timestamps in filenames. Subsequent runs create new files rather than overwriting previously retrieved files.

### 7. Build the database (M2)

From a fresh clone with landed raw data in `data/raw/`:

```bash
python src/load.py      # builds data/asteroids.db from scratch; safe to run again
python src/checks.py    # runs the six checks on a temporary copy (see Checks below)
```

`load.py` reads only the files in `data/raw/` and never calls the API. It creates `data/asteroids.db` if it does not exist. Running it again leaves the database unchanged.

## Ingestion Scope — M1

Milestone M1 focuses on the ingestion stage of the data engineering lifecycle.

The ingestion script is designed to:

1. Retrieve data from the approved NASA NeoWs sources.
2. Save raw responses without cleaning, filtering, renaming, or reshaping them.
3. Include UTC retrieval timestamps in saved filenames.
4. Create new files on subsequent runs without overwriting previous files.
5. Read credentials from environment variables.
6. Handle request failures, timeouts, rate limits, and server errors.
7. Report the retrieved sources, record or file counts, and any errors.

Data cleaning, transformation, feature engineering, database loading, and machine learning are outside the scope of M1.

---

## Data Model — M2

Milestone M2 turns the landed raw files into a SQLite database that cannot contradict itself, refuses invalid data, and gives the same result however many times the load runs.

```

`orbits` is shown with a subset of its columns; all columns are in `sql/schema.sql`. `quarantine` has no foreign key on purpose: it holds records whose entity we do not have.

### Grain of every table

- `asteroids`: one row is one near-Earth asteroid, identified by NASA's id.
- `orbits`: one row is the latest known orbital solution of one asteroid (at most one per asteroid).
- `approaches`: one row is one close approach of one asteroid to one body (Earth, Moon, ...) at one moment (epoch).
- `quarantine`: one row is one raw record that could not be loaded, with the reason.

### Schema

The schema is in `sql/schema.sql` and uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` and `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`, so it can be run repeatedly.

- All four tables are `STRICT`.
- Entity tables have a surrogate `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY`; NASA's id is kept as `source_id TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE`.
- `approaches` has the composite primary key `(asteroid_key, epoch_date_close_approach, orbiting_body)`; every key column is `NOT NULL`.
- `orbits.asteroid_key` is `UNIQUE`, so an asteroid has at most one orbit row.
- Every relationship is a declared foreign key, and enforced: `connect()` in `src/db.py` runs `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` right after connecting, and every script uses it.
- Every table has `retrieved_at` (UTC), taken from the timestamp in the name of the raw file the row came from.
- Timestamps are ISO 8601 UTC text (`1901-08-23T17:36Z`); dates are zero-padded `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Asteroid status flags are constrained to `0`, `1`, or `NULL`.

### The loader

`python src/load.py` reads every `.json` file in `data/raw/` (the `browse` shape, a list of asteroids; the `feed` shape, asteroids grouped by date; and the `lookup` shape, one asteroid object per file) and loads three entity/event tables plus quarantine.

File names carry the UTC retrieval time with or without microseconds (`20261017T123742Z`, `20261017T125321207719Z`). Both are read, and `retrieved_at` is always stored with six fractional digits (`2026-10-17T12:53:21.207719Z`) so that comparing the text gives the same order as comparing the times.

- **Deduplication by key, not by row.** Records are grouped by their key; the version with the latest `retrieved_at` wins. The decision uses the timestamp in the file name, never the order in which files are read.
- **Upserts.** All writes use `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE` with a guard on `retrieved_at`. No `INSERT OR REPLACE` (it would change surrogate keys) and no `df.to_sql`.
- **Atomic.** The whole load runs in one transaction (`with con:`). A broken raw file stops the run before anything is written; an error during writing rolls everything back. The schema is created before the transaction starts.
- **Parameterised.** Every value reaches SQL through a `:name` or `?` placeholder.
- **Validation.** Text where a number belongs becomes `NULL` and is counted. Timestamps are converted to ISO 8601 UTC before insertion.

### Run summary

Output of two consecutive runs on a fresh database, built from the 360 landed raw files (256 browse, 4 feed, 100 lookup):

```text
# run 1

approaches: 150,936 in database (+150936 this run)
values cleaned: 0 (non-numeric/invalid -> NULL)
quarantined: 0 in table (+0 this run)
foreign_key_check: OK
STATUS: COMPLETE

# run 2
files read: 360 raw files (2026-10-17 .. 2026-10-17)
asteroids: 5,033 in database (+0 this run)
orbits: 5,000 in database (+0 this run)
approaches: 150,936 in database (+0 this run)
values cleaned: 0 (non-numeric/invalid -> NULL)
quarantined: 0 in table (+0 this run)
foreign_key_check: OK
STATUS: COMPLETE
```

### Decisions and findings

**Keys.**
- Asteroid: surrogate `asteroid_key`; NASA's `id` is kept as `source_id`.
- Approach: `(asteroid_key, epoch_date_close_approach, orbiting_body)`. The epoch is an integer in milliseconds since 1970 (UTC), so no time-zone conversion is needed.
- Tests, run on the 360 landed raw files with `src/key_tests.py`:
  - Uniqueness: (asteroid id, epoch) alone is **not** unique: 15 pairs appear twice in the same file, once for Earth and once for the Moon (or Venus/Mars), with different miss distances. With (asteroid id, epoch, orbiting body) there are 0 duplicates, so the body is part of the key. Our first key, tested on 4 files from 2026-10-12, had missed this; with it, the loader silently kept only one of the two approaches.
  - Stability: 0 asteroids changed name between files, and 0 keys had more than one `miss_distance` value across files.
  - References: approaches and orbits are nested inside their asteroid in the source, so every one resolves by construction. The load confirmed it: 0 quarantined records and `foreign_key_check: OK`.
  - Limit of these tests: all raw files were retrieved on 2026-10-17, so they say little about how values change over several days. We will re-check once more retrievals exist.

**Missing values.** A field that is absent in the source is stored as `NULL` and means "not provided by the source", never zero. A value that is present but cannot be converted (for example text where a number belongs) is also stored as `NULL` and counted in the run summary as "values cleaned". In the current data this count is 0.

**Timestamps.** `close_approach_date_full` ("1901-Aug-23 17:36") and `orbit_determination_date` ("2026-10-11 06:57:01") are assumed to be UTC and stored as ISO 8601. If `close_approach_date` is invalid, it is derived from the epoch and counted as cleaned.

**Unknown references.** A record that points to an asteroid we do not have goes to the `quarantine` table with a reason and its raw JSON; it is neither dropped nor does it stop the load. Quarantine writes are idempotent (`UNIQUE` plus `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`). Because approaches and orbits arrive nested inside their asteroid, orphans are not expected; the quarantine mostly catches records without an id or with an invalid epoch. Current count: 0.

**Change over time.** We use type 1: the version with the latest `retrieved_at` wins. A renamed asteroid is updated in place and keeps its `asteroid_key`. M6 may revisit this.

**Known issues.**
- 33 of 5,033 asteroids have no orbit row. They appear only in `feed` files, which carry no `orbital_data`. The schema allows asteroids without orbits; the data can be completed later from the `lookup` endpoint.
- All 360 raw files were retrieved on 2026-10-17, so the "latest retrieval wins" rule has only been exercised within one day.
- Raw files come in three shapes (`browse`, `feed`, `lookup`); the loader handles all three.
- We have not checked whether `epoch_date_close_approach` and `close_approach_date_full` always describe the same instant.

### Checks

`src/checks.py` runs against a temporary copy of the database (never the real one) and reports PASS or FAIL for: duplicate natural key, orphan event, NULL key, wrong type, idempotence, and atomicity. It exits with code 1 if any check fails.

Checks 1–4 each have two parts: a **scan** that confirms the loaded data has no violation, and a **probe** that tries a deliberately bad write (a duplicate key, an approach for an unknown asteroid, a `NULL` key, text in a number column, a flag value of 7) and confirms that SQLite refuses it. The probe shows that the guarantee comes from the schema, not from the data happening to be clean. Probes run inside a savepoint and are rolled back.

- **Idempotence:** loads all raw files again into the copy and compares row counts and table contents before and after.
- **Atomicity:** (a) on a new empty database, a trigger makes the load fail after 1,000 approaches have been written; afterwards every table must be empty. (b) A broken JSON file is added to a copy of the raw folder; the load must stop before writing anything.

### Analytical query

`sql/queries/asteroid_analysis.sql`:

```sql
-- Question: How do potentially hazardous asteroids differ from non-hazardous ones
--           in their orbits and in their close approaches to Earth?
--
-- Result grain: one row per value of asteroids.is_potentially_hazardous (1 = hazardous, 0 = not).
--
-- Why the aggregation is correct at this grain:
--   approaches has many rows per asteroid (one per close approach), orbits has at most one.
--   Joining approaches straight onto asteroids and then averaging would weight every asteroid
--   by its number of approaches, and COUNT(*) would count approaches instead of asteroids.
--   So the CTE first collapses approaches to ONE row per asteroid (Earth approaches only),
--   and only then is it LEFT JOINed to asteroids and orbits. After the joins every row is still
--   one asteroid, so COUNT(*) counts asteroids and each AVG gives every asteroid equal weight.
--   LEFT JOINs keep asteroids without an orbit or without an Earth approach; AVG skips their NULLs,
--   and the n_with_* columns show how many asteroids each average is based on.
--   H, MOID and diameter define the hazard label, so they are deliberately left out.

LEFT JOIN earth_approaches AS e ON e.asteroid_key = a.asteroid_key
GROUP BY a.is_potentially_hazardous
ORDER BY hazardous DESC;
```

Result:

| hazardous | n_asteroids | n_with_orbit | avg_eccentricity | avg_inclination_deg | avg_semi_major_axis_au | n_with_earth_approach | avg_earth_approaches | avg_closest_miss_million_km | avg_fastest_km_s |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1046 | 1037 | 0.507 | 13.5 | 1.67 | 1030 | 30.6 | 6.26 | 22.6 |
| 0 | 3987 | 3963 | 0.453 | 16.2 | 1.82 | 3127 | 23.8 | 17.97 | 18.1 |

About 21% of the asteroids (1,046 of 5,033) are labelled potentially hazardous. On average they have more eccentric, slightly less inclined orbits, make more recorded Earth approaches, come about three times closer at their closest approach (6.3 vs 18.0 million km) and pass faster. Closest miss distance is related to MOID, which is part of the label's definition, so that difference is partly built into the label. This is a descriptive comparison, not a model.

---

## Planned Analysis

In a later project stage, the asteroid, orbit, and close-approach data will be joined using the asteroid ID.

The analysis will compare potentially hazardous and non-hazardous asteroids and investigate associations between the hazard label and orbital or close-approach characteristics.

Absolute magnitude (H), minimum orbit intersection distance (MOID), and diameter will be excluded from predictive features, as specified in the project proposal.

Because potentially hazardous asteroids may be less common than non-hazardous asteroids, model evaluation will emphasize recall and PR-AUC rather than accuracy alone.

The objective is to investigate associations with a screening label, not to forecast asteroid impacts.

## Status

**M1 — Complete.** NASA NeoWs data ingestion is implemented. Raw API responses are preserved with UTC retrieval timestamps, and repeated runs create new files without overwriting previous data.

**M2 — Complete.** The SQLite schema, database connection utilities, idempotent loader, integrity checks, and analytical SQL query are implemented and tested. All six checks pass, including duplicate-key rejection, foreign-key integrity, type enforcement, idempotence, and atomicity.

The database contains 5,033 asteroids, 5,000 orbits, 150,936 close-approach records, and 0 quarantined records. The analytical query compares orbital and Earth close-approach characteristics between potentially hazardous and non-hazardous asteroids.
